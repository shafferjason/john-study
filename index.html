                        This study guide brings together careful examination of the Gospel of John with 
                        contemporary Christian music. Each lesson includes a detailed summary of the passage, 
                        a song that connects thematically to the text, and an explanation of how the music 
                        illuminates the biblical truth. Whether you're studying individually or as part of 
                        a group, these resources are designed to deepen your understanding of John's Gospel 
                        and help you encounter Jesus through both Scripture and song.

                        Welcome. "The Tenth Hour" is a musical project focused on the "turning point"—those life-changing moments where a person has a real encounter with God. The name comes from John 1:39, the <em>original</em> "tenth hour" when the first disciples met Jesus and their lives were changed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This study of the Gospel of John is our main inspiration. The book is filled with these powerful encounters. These lessons, with their themes of "struggle and grace" and "doubt and revelation", are what sparked these songs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our goal is to <strong>highlight the key points of each lesson</strong> by sharing a story, not by preaching. This music uses an "honest, earthy" folk-rock sound to tell a timeless truth through a real, personal story. As you go through this study, we hope this music feels less like a performance and more like a group of friends sharing their experience alongside you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our hope is that this music helps you connect with these lessons and makes the truths of the Gospel feel personal.
